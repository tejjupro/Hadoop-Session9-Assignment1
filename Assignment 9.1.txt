1. What is NoSQL data base?
NoSQL unlike the RDBMS follows dont store data in tabular formats. The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. 
key-value, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making 
some operations faster in NoSQL. NoSQL databases finds its use in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL 
Databases are prefered for their simplicity in design and horizontal scaling of cluster nodes to accomodate more 
capacity and faster execution at comparatively cheaper cost.


2. How does data get stored in NoSQl database?
Key/Value Databases- In this model, data is represented as a collection of key-value pairs. Eg: Voldemort, Redis, 
Scalaris

Columnar Databases- Stores columns of data together than rows. Query performance is often increased as a result, 
particularly in very large data sets. eg -HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra

Document Databases -Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the key-value store. A document can 
have any number of key pair values or key array values. The difference lies in the way the data is processed; in a 
key-value store the data is considered to be inherently opaque to the database, whereas a document-oriented system 
relies on internal structure in the document in order to extract metadata that the database engine uses for further 
optimization. eg -MongoDb, CouchDB

Graph Databases- data whose relations are well represented as a graph consisting of elements interconnected with a 
finite number of relations between them. The type of data could be social relations, public transport links, road 
maps or network topologies. eg - InfoGrid, Neo4j

3. What is a column family in HBase?
Columns in Apache HBase are grouped into column families. All column members of a column family have the same 
prefix. For example, the columns courses:history and courses:math are both members of the courses column family. The 
colon character (:) delimits the column family from the . The column family prefix must be composed of printable 
characters. The qualifying tail, the column family qualifier, can be made of any arbitrary bytes. Column families 
must be declared up front at schema definition time whereas columns do not need to be defined at schema time but can 
be conjured on the fly while the table is up an running.
Physically, all column family members are stored together on the filesystem. Because tunings and storage 
specifications are done at the column family level, it is advised that all column family members have the same 
general access pattern and size characteristics


4. How many maximum number of columns can be added to HBase table?
There are no limits to number of columns. Developers can choose either  
1) more rows with less columns 
2) more columns with less rows  


5. Why columns are not defined at the time of table creation in HBase?
HBase tables are created with column families which generally is not changed. The column keys are specified after 
the table is up and running. Operations such as tunings and storage specifications are done at the column family 
level and are hence stored in separate HFiles.
